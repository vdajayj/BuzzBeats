## About the Project

I created this fully responsive modern e-commerce application using:

- **Next.js and React**: For the full-stack development, ensuring seamless frontend and backend communication.
- **Sanity CMS**: For easy product management, allowing products to be added and edited on the go.
- **Advanced Cart Functionalities**: Supports adding, removing, and updating items in the cart.
- **Stripe Integration**: Secure payment processing for real-world transactions.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for all device sizes, ensuring a smooth shopping experience.

I built this project to learn and improve my skills in developing practical, full-stack e-commerce solutions.
